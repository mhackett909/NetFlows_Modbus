This project includes a PCAP parser and autoencoder for MODBUS captures. The parser partitions the packets and extracts statistical features for the autoencoder to learn from. The autoencoder has 16 possible configurations. This project is based on the netml study by Yang et al.

Please see my original NetFlows project for 5G version and more comprehensive documentation.
